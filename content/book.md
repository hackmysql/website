Don't have time to read [_Efficient MySQL Performance_](https://oreil.ly/efficient-mysql-performance)?
Here's the book (10 chapters) in one-liners.

1. Performance is query response time.
2. Proper left-most indexing is required for performance.
3. The less data, the better.
4. Access patterns (part of the workload) help or hinder performance.
5. Sharding is how to scale writes when single-node performance is truly reached.
6. Server metrics reflect how the app workload causes MySQL to work.
7. Replication lag is data loss.
8. Locks are held until a transaction commits, so commit quickly.
9. There are many other challenges that you might need to address&mdash;sorry.
10. MySQL in the cloud is slower _and_ more expensive, so performance is more important than ever.
